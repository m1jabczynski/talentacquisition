# Recruitment Philosophy

Recruiting talent of any scope in the current market requires integration of  modern data analytics, tracking systems, and intuitive sourcing strategies that allow the professional recruiter to utilize these tools to better complete the core function of communicating with talent and winning them for the organizations further growth. 

Putting the "Human" back into **Human Resources** is a key strategy in today's job market with employees are craving transparency from the companies they work for.

# Search Strategy and Process

## Intake 
While working with leadership and executive stakeholders, I take a consultative approach to learn about the boardroom dynamics that the new staff member will encounter in addition to the core criteria and responsibilities of the role. 

The higher up the corporate ladder you go, *soft skills* become **more** relevant than even the most crucial of technical disciplines. 

Each executive search starts with a small team of Talent Partner and the Executive in charge of filling the role. It's the job of the Talent Partner to ask questions about what they are looking for **and** what they learned about the role's incumbent. Why fill a seat with the same problems?

Once I have a strong grasp of the need and the environment a diligent Talent Partner doesn't waste any time and will start the search. 

## Search
I will take a list of criteria, soft skills and historical context the executive has shared and begin investigating passive talent in the same or similar industries, looking for opportunities to find a lead into casual conversation. Most new employees

# Selection Criteria
Modern candidate selection should incorporate more than the *gut feeling* of a manager. Professional intuition can be a good guidepost when used with mitigated biases in the workplace. 

To ensure your staff gain and retain the best and most diver talent, along with keeping your organization in **compliance** it's important to incorporate the following guidelines. *I have had the opportunity to develop, implement and train leaders on the following items.*

1. Track applicant demographic markers to ensure applicants are being reviewed and interviewed equitably and coach managers who may be exhibiting certain biases within the candidate pool. 
2. Develop and implement manager/staff equity training on bias mitigation, compliance based interview questions and competency driven vetting. 
3. Benchmark yearly goals for leaders to review data trends in hiring. *Ensure the mission you set out on is remaining on track and be comfortable pivoting when plans may not be working out.*

# Negotiation Strategies

Candidate negotiation is the bread and butter of a strong recruiting team. A good executive sees their Recruiting team as an hybrid between HR and Sales. Often skills found in one discipline are cross referenced from another on a daily basis and no more than in the negotiation stage. 

Pay transparency starts with the Recruiter and the job posting but it ends with the consistent conversations Recruiters are having with their candidates. **It's not about the bottom dollar** and a Recruiter should never make it about money alone. It's about a partnership where a prospect needs to feel valued and the organization needs to remain equitable to what they pay their current staff. 

I've been a part of several equity reviews on candidates and it's important to use a Recruiter as the negotiator and the protector of the organizations finances. Talent Acquisition is where the company meets the public and we should never forget that unique relationship. 

### When Negotiations Should End
Letting an executive candidate walk away is the most empowering thing a professional should be prepared to do but not without putting up a strong effort. 

Recruiting teams need to pull in all the stakeholders and mediate issues with executive boards, Compensation departments, Finance and the top staff that may be impacted by a golden parachute being given when they themselves saw none of it.

# Applicant Tracking Systems
### Workday
#### Summary of Experience
3 years working with Workday Recruiting module as the daily driver for applicant tracking and job requisition management. 

#### Notable Items
In 2022 I was asked to head up the Workday Recruiting implementation project. We had been testing the product for several months and were asked to quickly implement a fully functional ATS within a few months along with porting over a large dataset. 

I acted as the SME and Project Lead for the implementation and the ongoing liaison with the HRIS team to develop quality of life improvements as the go-live date. 

### PCRecruiter
Utilized this platform for nearly 5 years while working for Weaver Partners. Experience with email integrations for cataloging notes and updates from candidates. 

Also used the platform as a client CRM tool to capture contacts and conversations for follow up.
