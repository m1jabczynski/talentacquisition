## Selection Criteria
Modern candidate selection should incorporate more than the *gut feeling* of a manager. Professional intuition can be a good guidepost when used with mitigated biases in the workplace. 

To ensure your staff gain and retain the best and most diver talent, along with keeping your organization in **compliance** it's important to incorporate the following guidelines. *I have had the opportunity to develop, implement and train leaders on the following items.*

1. Track applicant demographic markers to ensure applicants are being reviewed and interviewed equitably and coach managers who may be exhibiting certain biases within the candidate pool. 
2. Develop and implement manager/staff equity training on bias mitigation, compliance based interview questions and competency driven vetting. 
3. Benchmark yearly goals for leaders to review data trends in hiring. *Ensure the mission you set out on is remaining on track and be comfortable pivoting when plans may not be working out.*
