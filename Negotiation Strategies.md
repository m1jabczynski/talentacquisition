## Negotiation Strategies

Candidate negotiation is the bread and butter of a strong recruiting team. A good executive sees their Recruiting team as an hybrid between HR and Sales. Often skills found in one discipline are cross referenced from another on a daily basis and no more than in the negotiation stage. 

Pay transparency starts with the Recruiter and the job posting but it ends with the consistent conversations Recruiters are having with their candidates. **It's not about the bottom dollar** and a Recruiter should never make it about money alone. It's about a partnership where a prospect needs to feel valued and the organization needs to remain equitable to what they pay their current staff. 

I've been a part of several equity reviews on candidates and it's important to use a Recruiter as the negotiator and the protector of the organizations finances. Talent Acquisition is where the company meets the public and we should never forget that unique relationship. 

### When Negotiations Should End
Letting an executive candidate walk away is the most empowering thing a professional should be prepared to do but not without putting up a strong effort. 

Recruiting teams need to pull in all the stakeholders and mediate issues with executive boards, Compensation departments, Finance and the top staff that may be impacted by a golden parachute being given when they themselves saw none of it.
