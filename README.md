# Recruitment Philosophy
[Top of page](#table-of-contents)

Recruiting talent at any scale requires integration of modern data analytics, tracking systems, and intuitive sourcing strategies that allow the  recruiter to successfully achieve the core function of their trade, communicating and winning new talent for the organizations they work for. 

Putting the "Human" back into **Human Resources** is a key strategy in today's job market. Employees are craving transparency from the companies they work for in facets such as:
 - Salary
 - Benefits
 - Job Responsibilities
 - Work Location

&nbsp;

# Search Strategy and Process
[Top of page](#table-of-contents)

## Intake 
While working with **department leaders and executive stakeholders**, I take a consultative approach to learn about the boardroom dynamics that the new staff member will encounter in addition to the core criteria and responsibilities of the role. 

The higher up the corporate ladder you go, *soft skills* become **more** relevant than even the most in-demand technical disciplines. 

Each executive search starts with a **partnership** between Talent Partner and the Leader in charge of filling the role. It's the job of the Talent Partner to ask questions about what they are looking for **and** what they learned about the role's incumbent. 

&nbsp;

> Why fill a seat with the same problems?

&nbsp;

Once they have a strong grasp of the **need** and the environment the new hire will be stepping into, a diligent Talent Partner doesn't waste any time and will start the search. 

&nbsp;

> Proactive recruiters are those that know their boundaries but don't wait for constant direction. Our job is to provide leaders with what they **want** and what they **need**.

&nbsp;

## Search
I will take a list of criteria, soft skills, and historical context the Executive or Leader in charge has shared, and begin investigating passive talent in the same or similar industries, looking for opportunities to find a lead into casual conversation.

# Selection Criteria
[Top of page](#table-of-contents)

Modern candidate selection should incorporate more than the *gut feeling* of a manager. Professional intuition can be a good guidepost when used with mitigated biases in the workplace. 

To ensure your staff gain and retain the best and most diverse talent, along with keeping your organization in **compliance** it's important to incorporate the following guidelines. *I have had the opportunity to develop, implement and train leaders on the following items.*

1. Track applicant demographic markers to ensure applicants are being reviewed and interviewed equitably and coach managers who may be exhibiting certain biases within the candidate pool. 
2. Develop and implement manager/staff equity training on bias mitigation, compliance based interview questions and competency driven vetting. 
3. Benchmark yearly goals for leaders to review data trends in hiring.

&nbsp;

> [!TIP]
> Ensure the mission you set out is remaining on track and be comfortable pivoting when plans may not be working out.


&nbsp;

# Negotiation Strategies
[Top of page](#table-of-contents)

Candidate negotiation is the bread and butter of a strong recruiting team. A good executive sees their Recruiting team as  hybrid between HR and Sales. Often skills found in one discipline are cross referenced from another on a daily basis and no more than in the negotiation stage. 

Pay transparency starts with the Recruiter and the job posting but it ends with the consistent conversations Recruiters are having with their candidates. **It's not about the bottom dollar** and a Recruiter should never make it about money alone. It's about a partnership where a prospect needs to feel valued and the organization needs to remain equitable to what they pay their current staff. 

I've been a part of several equity reviews on candidates and it's important to use a Recruiter as the negotiator and the protector of the organizational finances. Talent Acquisition is where the company meets the public and we should never forget that unique relationship. 

&nbsp;

### When Should Negotiations End?
Letting an executive candidate, or any candidate, walk away is the most empowering thing a professional should be prepared to do but not without putting up a strong effort. 

Recruiting teams need to pull in all the stakeholders and mediate issues with Executive boards, Compensation departments, Finance and the top staff that may be impacted by a golden parachute being given when they themselves saw none of it.

### Workday
#### Summary of Experience
3 years working with Workday Recruiting module as the daily driver for applicant tracking and job requisition management.
