# Workday
## Summary of Experience
3 years working with Workday Recruiting module as the daily driver for applicant tracking and job requisition management. 

### Notable Items
In 2022 I was asked to head up the Workday Recruiting implementation project. We had been testing the product for several months and were asked to quickly implement a fully functional ATS within a few months along with porting over a large dataset. 

I acted as the SME and Project Lead for the implementation and the ongoing liaison with the HRIS team to develop quality of life improvements as the go-live date.
